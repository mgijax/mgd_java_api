/**
 * Is a Unix shell command to be run in a Bourne shell (by default).
 * @has A shell command and an optional environment.
 * @does Runs the command; captures stdout, stderr, and exit code, and
 * provides accessors for them.
 * @notes <pre>This is not thread safe.
 *  Usage:
 *  There are basically three ways to use this class:
 *   1) To just quickly run a command:
 *      use the static class method 'runCommand' which takes a command
 *      and an optional environment as parameter(s), runs the command,
 *      and returns an object of the class with which one can access
 *      stdout, stderr, and exitcode with accessor methods. e.g.
 *      Example:
 *          RunCommand runner = RunCommand.runCommand(cmd);
 *          int ec = runner.getExitCode();
 *          if(ec != 0)
 *           System.err.println(runner.getStdErr());
 *          else
 *           System.out.println(runner.getStdOut());
 *
 *   2) To create an object with a command to run in the future:
 *      explicitly create a RunCommand object passing
 *      a command and an optional environment as parameter(s).
 *      Use the run() method to run the command and return the
 *      exit code. Use the accessors for stdout and stderr to get
 *      their values. e.g.
 *      Example:
 *      RunCommand runner = new RunCommand(cmd);
 *      int ec = runner.run();
 *      use accessors for stdout and stderr if desired
 *
 *   3) To create an object and both set and run the command at some time
 *       in the future:
 *      create a default RunCommand object. Use setCommand(cmd) and
 *      optionally setEnv(envp). Use the run() method to run the
 *      command and return the exit code. Use the accessors for
 *      stdout and stderr. Note: setCommand() always resets
 *      the state of the object - see it's method header.
 *      Example:
 *          RunCommand runner = new RunCommand();
 *          runner.setCommand(cmd);
 *          runner.setEnv(envp);
 *          int ec = runner.run();
 *          use accessors for stdout and stderr if desired
 *   Implementation:
 *   Explanation of command and environment parameters
 *   1) the command parameter is a String
 *      e.g. String cmd = "ls -al /home/sc/work";
 *      This class passes 'cmd' to the Bourne shell (sh) by default.
 *      It does this by passing a String array to Runtime.exec() with
 *      "/usr/bin/sh" in position 0, "-c" in position 1, and 'cmd' in
 *      position 2. See the Java1.2 API docs for the exec method in the
 *      Runtime class for more information.
 *      If you'd like  to use another shell specify it as part of the
 *      command
 *      e.g. String cmd = "/usr/bin/csh -c
 *        'cat /home/sc/work/lib/*.java > testRC.out'";
 *      This will open a Bourne shell, then invoke the c-shell within it,
 *      then have csh execute the command specified after the -c
 *      Important: Note the single quotes surrounding 'cmd' after the -c
 *   2) the environment parameter:
 *      This is a String[] of environment settings in the format:
 *      name=value. e.g. {"PRINTER=bentley", "USER=sc"}
 *
 * </pre>
